# Work Day Scheduler

This is a simple work day scheduler web app that allows users to enter and save tasks for specific hours of the work day, and see the current date and time. The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the jQuery library, and uses the Day.js library for time and date manipulation.
## Usage

To use the app, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. The app will display the current date at the top of the page, and each hour of the work day (9am to 5pm) will be displayed in a separate time block. You can click on the text area in each time block to enter and save a task for that hour. To save a task, click the "save" button to the right of the text area. The app will save your tasks in your browser's local storage, so they will persist even if you close the app or refresh the page.

The app also uses color coding to indicate whether each time block is in the past, present, or future. The current time block will be highlighted in red, time blocks in the past will be gray, and time blocks in the future will be green.
